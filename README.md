# CloudFlare-subdomain
CloudFlare subdomain creator currently intended for Minecraft hosts. You'll notice it's unstyled and looks ugly. This is to encourage each host/user to make the design their own rather than having a bunch of people running around with the same design.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute by forking the repository and submitting a pull request when you're done.

# To-do
- I'd like to somehow build this to where it can create subdomains for multiple services. For example Teamspeak.
- Write own class to communicate with CloudFlare API v4 rather than using a 3rd party class that communicates with the old v1 API.
